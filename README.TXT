DESCRIPTION: mazecrawler is a Pacman-esque, multiplayer game built using Python3 and Pygame. During gameplay, players race against the clock as they try to collect more points than their opponent. As the levels progress, they face gameboards generated by different maze algorithms. They must run from AI monsters and avoid getting hit by AI ammunition shot by their opponent.

mazecrawler utilizes sockets, file IO, subprocesses, five random maze generating algorithms (Eller’s, Sidewinder, Hunt and Kill, Recursive Division, Binary), and artificial intelligence backed by two advanced path-finding algorithms (Dijkstra’s, A*).
HOW TO PLAY: Install Python3 and Pygame (pip install Python3 and Pygame). To run the file using terminal, navigate into the game directory, and simply run "python3 main.py". 

NOTE: To run the server and the clients on separate computers, add your server’s IP address as HOST in server.py (line 18).
